## Database Schema

### New Tables
- `clients`: Client information (ID, name, description)
- `printers`: Printer management (supplier, employee, client assignments)
- `pdas`: PDA devices (serial number, client assignment, SIM card status)
- `client_history`: History tracking for client changes
- `printer_history`: History tracking for printer changes
- `pda_history`: History tracking for PDA changes

### Relationships
- Printers belong to clients (many-to-one)
- PDAs belong to clients (many-to-one)
- Printers can be assigned to employees (optional)
- All entities have complete audit trails

## Navigation
New menu items have been added to the sidebar:
- **Clients** (building icon)
- **Printers** (print icon)
- **PDAs** (mobile icon)

## History Tracking
All three entities maintain complete audit trails including:
- Creation events
- Update events with before/after values
- Deletion events
- User attribution
- Timestamps

## Installation
The database schema has been updated with the new tables. When setting up a database:

1. Run the schema.sql file to create all tables
2. The sample data includes 3 clients, 4 printers, and 5 PDAs for testing
